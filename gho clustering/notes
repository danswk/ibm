- Dataset best organised into 2 clusters
- k-means and (agglomerative) hierarchal clustering models perform best
- Model with chosen elbow point does not necessarily produce highest score (애매하고 선택은 주관적이기 때문)
- Silhouette score does not strictly decrease with number of clusters but periodically increases slightly
- Alcohol consumption contributes most to classification into 'Developed' minority class; GDP (per capita) most to 'Developing' majority
