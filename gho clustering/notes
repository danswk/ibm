# DATA
- Data best organised into 2 clusters
- Alcohol consumption contributes most to classification into 'Developed' minority class
- GDP (1인당) contributes most to 'Developing' majority class

# MODELS
- k-means and (agglomerative) hierarchal clustering models perform best
  - Former has highest silhouette score of all models tested (0.3556)
    - Overall performance is poor - 0.7+ generally considered strong clustering solution
- Model with chosen elbow point does not necessarily produce highest score (애매하고 선택은 주관적이기 때문)
- Score does not strictly decrease with number of clusters but periodically increases slightly
