    - Misclassified countries reclassified by 2014 UN standard: un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wesp/wesp_current/2014wesp_country_classification.pdf
    - Null data removed, missing data filled with closest 3-year average or average of region
    - Countries missing 4< data columns (e.g. South Sudan, North Korea) omitted

# LOGISTIC REGRESSION
- Regularisation has little effect on model performance though L2-regularised model did slightly outperform others
- Thinness (in young people up to 19 years) has strongest positive correlation with log-odds of target variable ('Status') belonging to positive class ('Developing')
  - Checks out as developing countries more likely to suffer from food scarcity
- Human Development Index (in terms of income composition of resources) has strongest negative correlation
  - Checks out as both features track same characteristic but 'Status' variable is categorical representation

# K-NEAREST NEIGHBOURS
- Minority ('Developed') class predicted best when considering 2 nearest neighbours
- Majority ('Developing') class predicted best when considering only single nearest

# RANDOM FOREST
- Alcohol (consumption per capita in litres) has greatest effect on predictions by random forest classifier
  - Unexpected as I did not personally associate alcohol consumption with development status
- HIV/AIDS (deaths per 1,000 live births (0-4 years)) has least effect
  - Implies deaths from HIV/AIDS are not more common in developing countries compared to developed countries or vice-versa to a significant degree

# EXTRA TREES
- Best-performing classifier of those tested
- Minority class predicted with 96% precision, 99% recall, 98% F-1 score
- Majority class predicted with 100% precision, 99% recall, 100% F-1 score
- Model accuracy: 99%

# 앞으로 참고하고 주의할 것
- Use updated dataset in future projects
- Minority class is typically regarded as positive (1) class for imbalanced datasets but LinearRegression(CV) object assigns [0,1] to ['Developed','Developing'] alphabetically
  - Attribute 'classes_' shows 'array(['Developed', 'Developing'], dtype=object)'
  - Confusion matrix can be reordered by adding parameter 'labels=['Developing','Developed']'
  - Unsure how to invariably designate 'Developed' as positive class to see coefficients WRT log-odds of data belonging to developed country
