    - Misclassified countries reclassified by 2014 UN standard: un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wesp/wesp_current/2014wesp_country_classification.pdf
    - Null data removed, missing data filled with closest 3-year average or average of region
    - Countries missing 4< data columns (e.g. South Sudan, North Korea) omitted

# LOGISTIC REGRESSION
- Regularisation has little effect on model performance though L2-regularised model did slightly outperform others
- Thinness (in young people up to 19 years) has strongest positive correlation with majority class ('Developing') of target variable ('Status')
  - Checks out as developing countries more likely to suffer from food scarcity
- Human Development Index (in terms of income composition of resources) has strongest negative correlation
  - Checks out as both features track same characteristic but 'Status' variable is categorical representation

# K-NEAREST NEIGHBOURS
- 'Developed' class predicted best when considering 2 nearest neighbours
- 'Developing' class predicted best when considering only single nearest

# RANDOM FOREST
- Alcohol (consumption per capita in litres) has greatest effect on predictions by random forest classifier
  - Unexpected as I did not personally associate alcohol consumption with development status
- HIV/AIDS (deaths per 1,000 live births (0-4 years)) has least effect
  - Implies deaths from HIV/AIDS are not more common in developing countries compared to developed countries or vice-versa to a significant degree

# EXTRA TREES
- Best-performing classifier of those tested
- Positive 'Developed' class predicted with 96% precision, 99% recall, 98% F-1 score
- Negative 'Developing' class predicted with 100% precision, 99% recall, 100% F-1 score
- Model accuracy: 99%
