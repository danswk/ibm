# LINEAR
- Adding (210) polynomial features reduced test set MSE by ~31% (16.960130 ▶ 11.666972), improved R^2 score by ~6% (0.834491 ▶ 0.886146)
- Highest R^2 score of models tested; regularisation harms model performance (too much bias introduced)

# LASSO
- Model is worse fit than horizontal line (R^2<0) for alpha range 1e-9~1e-4
- Best performance (R^2=0.874703) for alpha=1e-1=0.1

# RIDGE
- Model is worse fit than horizontal line (R^2<0) for alpha range 1e-9~1e-4
- Very poor (R^2<-1) performance for alpha range 1e-9~1e-5
- Best performance (R^2=0.830862) for alpha=1e0=1

# ELASTIC NET
- Model is worse fit than horizontal line (R^2<0) for alpha range 1e-9~1e-6
  - Tightest range of R^2 scores of models tested
- Best performance (R^2=0.878522) for alpha=1e-1=0.1

# 앞으로 참고하고 주의할 것
  - Scatter plot decent for visualising accuracy/consistency of predictions but not ideal for gauging performance across different models
    - Plots are too similar to compare
    - Could add LOBF and residual lines or plot only residuals
