# OBSERVATIONS
- Initially tried to fit model without padding train, test sequences
  - Using batch_size without padding fails because all sequences in batch must be same length
- Accuracy fluctuated 0.9464~0.9465 for majority of epoch 2
  - too many train samples?

# 앞으로 참고하고 주의할 것
- define sep validation set?
