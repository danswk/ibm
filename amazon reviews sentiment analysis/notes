# 앞으로 참고하고 주의할 것
* Model has 1M+ parameters
  - Fitting to data takes 1h+
  - Could simplify layers and compare performance to see if model is unnecessarily deep
- Initially tried to fit model without padding train, test sequences
  - Using batch_size without padding fails because all sequences in batch must be same length
  - Tested different methods of preparing data for model fitting
    - convert_to_tensor: only takes sequences of same length but train, test data not padded
- Accuracy fluctuated 0.9463~0.9465 for majority of epoch 2
  * Too many training samples for degree of payoff
- Tested different methods of scoring model performance
  - classification_report: only takes binary values but test_labels_pred values are float
